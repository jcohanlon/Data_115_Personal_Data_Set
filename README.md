# Ages of Formula 1 GP Winners
# Motivation
As a sports fan over the last summer full of covid cancellations and delays in pro sports leagues I desperately looked for something to fill the void. Formula 1 was one of the only sport on throughout the summer so naturally I got invested in it. As I am still a novice fan in the sport having only watched one season I thought I would do some some statistical analysis on some questions that I had. Although, my question has changed multiple times I finally found some that interested me, "How does age affect GP wins in formula 1?", "Are some tracks better the older or younger a driver is?", and "Has the ages of winning drivers changed over time?".

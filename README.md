# Ages of Formula 1 GP Winners
# Motivation
As a sports fan over the last summer full of covid cancellations and delays in pro sports leagues I desperately looked for something to fill the void. Formula 1 was one of the only sport on throughout the summer so naturally I got invested in it. As I am still a novice fan in the sport having only watched one season I thought I would do some some statistical analysis on some questions that I had. Although, my question has changed multiple times I finally found some that interested me, "How does age affect GP wins in formula 1?", "Are some tracks better the older or younger a driver is?", and "Has the ages of winning drivers changed over time?".
# Data Process
I got my data from a Formula 1 statistics website titled Stats F1 (https://www.statsf1.com/en/statistiques/pilote/victoire/age.aspx). From here I took the data from the top 110 youngest drivers to win a Grand Prix in formula history as well as the data from the top 110 oldest drivers to win a Grand Prix in formula one history (Not including the first two races of 2021). I then copied this data into excel and had to do a little bit of cleaning. To start with I had to remove hyperlinks from the Names of the Drivers and the tracks. From there I had to seperate out the tracks from the years of the races so that I could analyse both of those variables differently. Additionally, the ages of the driver were to the day so I had to make a column of just the year so it would be simpler to analyse. Lastly, there are repeats of names but I did not delete them as sometimes the same driver won at a young age and a older age so it did not make sense to delete them as the age of the driver at the time of winning a GP is what's important.
